# pyKaruga: a 2D space shooter like IKaruga.

a python game written with pyGame and 2 player support because I can't find good vertical scrolling shooters.  

** Requirements: **
- Python
- pyGame

** Controls: **

Player 1:
- Left/Right/Up/Down: arrow keys
- shoot: hold space bar
- switch polarity: b

Player 2:
- Left/Right/Up/Down: a/d/w/s
- shoot: hold z
- switch polarity: x

Controls can be configured by changing the bindings in configs.py

** Enabling second player **
Change NUM_PLAYERS in configs.py from 1 to 2
