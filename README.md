# pyKaruga: a 2D space shooter like IKaruga.

a python game written with pyGame and 2 player support because I can't find good vertical scrolling shooters.  

**Requirements:**

+  Python
+  pyGame

**Controls:**

Player 1:

+  Left/Right/Up/Down: arrow keys
+  Shoot: hold space bar
+  Switch polarity: b

Player 2:

+  Left/Right/Up/Down: a/d/w/s
+  Shoot: hold z
+  Switch polarity: x

Controls can be configured by changing the bindings in configs.py

**Enabling second player:**

Change NUM_PLAYERS in configs.py from 1 to 2
